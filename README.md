# Scrimba Web Agency Hero

This is a solo project from https://scrimba.com that challenges you to make a Web Agency Hero website

In this project, I will be incorporating the following topics I learned from my previous lessons:

- Background images
- Webp format

- IDs & utility classes
- Text-shadow
